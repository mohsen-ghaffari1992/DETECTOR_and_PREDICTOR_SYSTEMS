# DETECTOR_and_PREDICTOR_SYSTEMS


PREDICTOR & DETECTOR SYSTEMS CODED IN PYTHON 3.7
The detector system is to assess the hazard places of a contagious disease in a city by using a supervised learning-based approach on the individuals' tracking trajectories. It is enabled to apply on a warning system that installs on mobile (or a specific warning device) and notifies the hazard of a place.
The predictor system predicts the possibility of getting the disease without testing. It is developed based on an HMM-based approach.
